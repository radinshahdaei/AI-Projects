# Text Classifier

In this repository, you'll find a Jupyter Notebook which includes the code for a BERT-based text classifier. This model classifies the genre of a movie based on the summary of it in english or persian. The accuracy of this model isn't very high because of the biased and small dataset used for the project. An in-depth explaratory data analysis was done on the dataset prior to training the transformer models. some of the results on the accuracy of the model are shown below:
